# Minimalistic Chat
![Alt text](./loggedinpage.png?raw=true)

## Problem
Nowadays, social networking sites are bloated with too many features. 
Site like Facebook penetrate every aspect of our life, from sharing our daily life to buying and selling.
It's great to have Facebook, but sometimes it felt a bit overwhelming when you think about how much information they have about you.
They persist all your data, from your embarrassing status back in 2008 to your conversations with your friends.

## Solution
Minimalistic Chat is a very simple chatting application where you can set a name, go to a chatroom and start talking about your anything!
And you bet it, we do not persist your conversation. You can start a chatroom and talk about anything. 
Life is short. Live in the moment. Don't look back.

## What's next?
New feature will be added later on. Now, I just want to keep it clean and simple.
